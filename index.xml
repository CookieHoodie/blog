Introduction Keychron keyboards sold by dealers in Singapore are usually more expensive than the price on Keychron&amp;rsquo;s official website, not to mention Keychron often has sales that makes the price difference even more stark.
For example, as of 12 May 2023, the official price of Keychron K8 RGB aluminum Hot-Swappable costs ~101.82 SGD: While the same model on Shopee costs 135 SGD: Granted, you need to add an extra 10 USD for the shipping fee if you buy from the official store, but in this case it&amp;rsquo;s still cheaper than buying from dealers.</description></item><item><title>How to Create a Logseq Plugin</title><link>https://cookiehoodie.github.io/blog/posts/tech/logseq-plugin/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Apr 2023 12:41:59 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://cookiehoodie.github.io/blog/posts/tech/logseq-plugin/</guid><description>Introduction Ever since I discovered Logseq, I have been using it as my daily note taking tool.

However, although the fee structure for deposits and withdrawals in SGD (with a Singapore bank account) is clearly stated, it&amp;rsquo;s not so clear on depositing/withdrawing other currencies like USD using a multi-currency account.
Since Webull uses a DBS multi-currency account under the hood to hold our funds, supposedly if we deposit or withdraw USD using a DBS multi-currency account as well, there should be no charges.</description></item><item><title>Migrate From create-react-app to Next.js for Static Site Generation</title><link>https://cookiehoodie.github.io/blog/posts/tech/react-to-nextjs/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Feb 2023 21:12:04 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://cookiehoodie.github.io/blog/posts/tech/react-to-nextjs/</guid><description>Introduction Recently, I was building my portfolio site using React and the built-in create-react-app toolchain. The webpage worked well and I was able to deploy it on GitHub Pages with ease. However, create-react-app uses client-side rendering, which causes an obvious layout shift of the components when the page is first loaded or refreshed. Not a big deal, but it&amp;rsquo;s annoyingðŸ˜ .
Since the webpage doesn&amp;rsquo;t change often, the best solution is to utilize static site generation (SSG), which pre-renders the page and thus eliminate the layout shift.</description></item><item><title>Using Docker with VSCode for Local Development</title><link>https://cookiehoodie.github.io/blog/posts/tech/docker-vscode-development/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Feb 2023 10:45:45 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://cookiehoodie.github.io/blog/posts/tech/docker-vscode-development/</guid><description>Introduction Whenever we want to start working on a new project with new tools or frameworks, the first step is always to install the dependencies for local development. However, the installation process could be painful especially if different versions of existing tools are needed, forcing us to have multiple versions that eat up the storage space on our device. Not to mention, the installed tools could be located all over the place, making it hard to locate and uninstall them when they are no longer needed.</description></item></channel></rss>
