&lt;p&gt;Recently, I opened a Webull Singapore account and the experience has been good so far. However, although the fee structure for deposits and withdrawals in SGD (with a Singapore bank account) is clearly stated, it&amp;rsquo;s not so clear on depositing/withdrawing other currencies like USD using a multi-currency account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Webull uses a DBS multi-currency account under the hood to hold our funds, supposedly if we deposit or withdraw USD using a DBS multi-currency account as well, there should be no charges. Sadly, there&amp;rsquo;s no official statement to verify the assumption, not to mention the scary &amp;ldquo;SGD20 charged by remitting bank for USD&amp;rdquo; mentioned on the &lt;a href="https://www.webull.com.sg/help/faq/1062-Are-there-any-withdrawal-fees"&gt;official FAQ&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
