However, although the fee structure for deposits and withdrawals in SGD (with a Singapore bank account) is clearly stated, it&amp;rsquo;s not so clear on depositing/withdrawing other currencies like USD using a multi-currency account.
Since Webull uses a DBS multi-currency account under the hood to hold our funds, supposedly if we deposit or withdraw USD using a DBS multi-currency account as well, there should be no charges.</description></item></channel></rss>
