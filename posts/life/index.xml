Introduction Keychron keyboards sold by dealers in Singapore are usually more expensive than the price on Keychron&amp;rsquo;s official website, not to mention Keychron often has sales that makes the price difference even more stark.
For example, as of 12 May 2023, the official price of Keychron K8 RGB aluminum Hot-Swappable costs ~101.82 SGD: While the same model on Shopee costs 135 SGD: Granted, you need to add an extra 10 USD for the shipping fee if you buy from the official store, but in this case it&amp;rsquo;s still cheaper than buying from dealers.</description></item></channel></rss>
