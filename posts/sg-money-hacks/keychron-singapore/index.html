However, it’s unclear if there would be any extra charges like import tax since it’s shipping from overseas to Singapore. Keychron’s shipping policy says that:\nDue to the customs policy of different destinations, we CANNOT guarantee if there is a tax for you. Our product price does not include VAT or import tax of your shipping destination.\nBut it adds that:\nFrom our previous experience, the following destinations haven’t been charged for import tax including the U.S, Singapore, South Korea and other EU (except remote area) such as Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom\nThe ambiguity adds uncertainty to the final price, but I decided to try my luck since the deal is too good to pass.\nThe Process Buying When buying, I put my Singapore address as the shipping address, and my Singapore phone number as the contact number. Nothing too fancy.\nI used my DBS multi-currency card (with sufficient USD inside) to pay so that it charges exactly the amount in USD without any conversion fee.\nShipping The keyboard was shipped out 2 business day later.\nReceiving It only took 5 business days (one week) for the keyboard to arrive after it was shipped out.\nAnd that’s it, no extra fee or tax imposed when receiving the keyboard!\nSummary There is no extra tax if you buy Keychron from the official website and ship it to Singapore, at least from my experience as of 2023. If your country is on the above list mentioned, chances are you could safely assume that there’d be no import tax as well.\nHope this helps those of you who hesitate to buy from the official store due to the import tax.
